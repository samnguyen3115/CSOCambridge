        <h2>What are CSOs?</h2>
        <p>
          Today, the City's sewer and drain collection systems consists of both
          separated and combined stormwater and sewer systems. During
          significant rain storms combined sewer systems may fill up beyond
          their capacity with a mixture of sanitary waste and rainwater.
          Combined Sewer Overflows (CSO) act like a relief valve allowing
          sewerage to discharge into waterways preventing sewerage backups into
          homes, businesses and streets. Cambridge’s combined sewer system ties
          into the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority's (MWRA) wastewater
          collection system which is treated and discharges at Deer Island.
          During periods of heavy rain both MWRA and Cambridge’s wastewater
          systems can become overwhelmed by rainwater releasing CSOs into both
          the Charles River and the Alewife Brook.

        <h2>What is being done about CSOs?</h2>
        <p>
          In August 2019, the Massachusetts Department of Environmental
          Protection (DEP) issued, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
          (EPA) subsequently approved, a Final Determination to Adopt Variances
          for Combined Sewer Overflow Discharges to the Charles River Basin and
          the Alewife Brook/Upper Mystic River Basin. The Variance is a
          short-term modification of the Massachusetts Water Quality Standards,
          which allows for limited combined sewer overflow (CSO) discharges from
          the outfalls along the Charles River and Alewife Brook. The Variances
          require that the communities of Cambridge and Somerville and the MWRA
          each submit draft CSO Control Plan scopes and schedules for DEP and
          EPA's review and approval for the CSO outfalls each agency owns and
          maintains.

        <h2>What has been completed?</h2>
        <p>
          As part of the Federal District Court Order in the Boston Harbor Case
          (D. Mass. C.A. No. 85-0489-RGS), the MWRA is required to undertake
          certain corrective actions to reduce or eliminate CSO discharges along
          Boston Harbor, the Mystic, Charles and Neponset rivers and Alewife
          Brook. MWRA developed a CSO Control Plan in 1994 which was implemented
          based on design and construction schedules mandated by the Federal
          Court as part of the Boston Harbor Court Case. MWRA and its
          communities with permitted CSO outfalls, including Boston, Cambridge,
          Chelsea and Somerville, have been reducing CSO discharges continuously
          since the 1980s. MWRA, Boston Water and Sewer Commission and the City
          of Cambridge have completed a number of projects to reduce CSOs to the
          Charles River. These projects have reduced average annual CSO
          discharge volume to the Charles River basin by 98% since 1988. Seven
          of the MWRA Long-Term CSO Control Program projects have contributed to
          the control of CSO discharges to the Alewife Brook. These completed
          projects have closed six CSO outfalls (half of the outfalls that were
          active in the late 1980s) and are predicted to reduce average annual
          CSO volume to Alewife Brook by 85% and reduce the frequency of CSO
          discharges among the six remaining outfalls from sixty-three
          activations a year to seven activations a year. Remaining CSO
          discharges are predicted to comply with Class B “fishable/swimmable”
          water quality standards 98% of the time. Major improvements to the
          regional wastewater collection and treatment system by MWRA and local
          system improvements by the communities, including the separation of
          combined sewers with construction of new storm drain systems, have
          contributed to the closing of many CSO outfalls and an 88% reduction
          in the total volume of CSO discharge overall. The CSO work is in part
          also guided by the CSO Variances issued by the Massachusetts
          Department of Environmental Protection for the Lower Charles
          River/Charles Basin and Alewife Brook/Upper Mystic River. For more
          information about these and the other projects in the Long-Term CSO
          Control Plan, their CSO control benefits, and water quality conditions
          and improvement, see MWRA’s finalCSO Annual Progress Report, filed
          with the Federal Court in March 2016 and MWRA CSO Control Plan Goals
          and Costs by Receiving Water (PDF, 2016). Six CSO outfalls along
          Alewife Brook remain following the completion of the MWRA’s Alewife
          Brook Long-Term CSO Control Plan (1 owned by MWRA, 4 owned by the City
          of Cambridge and 1 owned by the City of Somerville).

        <h2>Sewer Systems:</h2>
        <p>
          In Cambridge, the original sewer lines were engineered over 150 years
          ago as a combined system: sewage and rain water ran through the same
          pipes and discharged directly into the Charles River through tide
          gates. Separation of the combined sewer system began in the 1930’s.
          Separated systems are designed and constructed to convey only
          stormwater to the rivers and only sanitary waste to a treatment plant.
          During the past twenty years the City has increased its sewer
          separation and stormwater management efforts because of stricter
          environmental compliance regulations and a desire to provide a better
          quality to residents' daily lives. The city‘s collection system
          currently include approximately 113 miles of sanitary sewer, 99 miles
          of stormwater drains, and 40 miles of combined sewer. Approximately
          55% of the collection system owned and maintained by Cambridge has
          been separated. The City has developed a Ten Year Sewer and Drain
          Infrastructure Plan to prioritize construction and rehabilitation of
          the sewer and stormwater systems. The goals of sewer separation
          projects are: Improving the quality of waterways in Cambridge Reducing
          or eliminating combined sewer overflows Reducing or eliminating
          sanitary sewer backups Reducing flooding To date, the City’s efforts
          have resulted in measurably cleaner rivers and significantly reduced
          street flooding. Today, dedicated sewer lines and the remaining
          combined sewer lines are conveyed to the Massachusetts Water Resources
          Authority’s Deer Island Treatment Plant through 15 miles of
          high-capacity state-owned combined sewer interceptors. During
          significant rainfall events combined sewer overflows can still occur
          and discharge untreated sewerage into the Charles River or the Alewife
          Brook.
