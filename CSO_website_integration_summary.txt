Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) Website Integration: Comprehensive Summary of Changes and Approach

Introduction
------------
The City of Cambridge previously maintained three separate websites related to Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs):

1. General CSO Service Page: https://www.cambridgema.gov/Services/combinedseweroverflows
2. CSO Reporting Page: https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/publicworks/combinedseweroverflowreporting
3. CSO Control Plan Project Page: https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/publicworks/cityprojects/2022/updatedcombinedseweroverflowcsocontrolplan

Each site served a distinct purpose, but users often found it difficult to locate information, understand the relationships between CSO activities, and access timely updates. To address these issues, the City undertook a project to merge all three sites into a single, comprehensive CSO portal. This document details the changes made, the integration process, and the resulting improvements for both residents and City staff.

I. Content Consolidation and Organization
-----------------------------------------
A. Unified Navigation and Structure
- Developed a clear, multi-section navigation menu reflecting the main topics from all three sites:
  - CSO Overview & FAQs
  - CSO Reporting & Data
  - Public Notification & Health Information
  - Project Planning & Community Engagement
  - Documents & Resources
  - Contact & Service Requests
- Created a homepage with a concise summary of CSO issues, quick links to recent alerts, and a visual map of outfall locations.

B. Merging and De-duplicating Content
- Reviewed all three sites for overlapping information (e.g., definitions, health advisories, reporting instructions).
- Consolidated duplicate content, ensuring only the most current and accurate information was retained.
- Unified sections for CSO definitions, health and safety guidance, reporting procedures, and project updates.
- Provided a single glossary and FAQ section to clarify terminology and answer common questions.

C. Consistent Terminology and Formatting
- Standardized terminology (e.g., “CSO event,” “outfall,” “discharge volume”) across all sections.
- Applied a consistent visual style, font, and color scheme for improved readability and accessibility.
- Ensured all images, diagrams, and tables were updated to match the new design and context.

II. Technical and Functional Changes
------------------------------------
A. Data Integration
- Combined historical and real-time CSO event data from the reporting site into a single interactive table.
- Added filtering, sorting, and search capabilities for users to find specific events, locations, or dates.
- Integrated downloadable annual reports and project documents from the control plan site.
- Linked to external resources (MWRA, MassDEP, Somerville) for broader context and regulatory compliance.

B. Interactive Features
- Embedded a dynamic map showing CSO outfall locations, catchment areas, and recent events.
- Implemented collapsible sections and tabbed navigation for easier browsing of large datasets and documents.
- Added interactive charts and graphs to visualize trends in CSO activations, rainfall, and discharge volumes.

C. Public Notification System
- Centralized public health notifications and advisories, previously scattered across multiple pages.
- Automated display of current alerts and advisories based on the latest CSO event data.
- Provided a subscription option for residents to receive email or SMS notifications about new CSO events or health advisories.

D. Contact and Service Requests
- Moved all contact forms and service request links to a single, prominent section at the bottom of the site.
- Simplified the form submission process and clarified instructions for residents.
- Added a feedback form for users to suggest improvements or report issues with the site.

III. User Experience Improvements
---------------------------------
A. Accessibility
- Ensured all content meets WCAG accessibility standards (contrast, font size, alt text for images).
- Improved mobile responsiveness and layout for all devices.
- Added skip-to-content links and keyboard navigation for users with disabilities.

B. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
- Updated meta tags, page titles, and descriptions to reflect the unified site.
- Redirected old URLs to the new site to preserve search rankings and avoid broken links.

- Published a calendar of upcoming events and deadlines related to CSO projects and public input.

IV. Migration and Maintenance
----------------------------
A. Redirects and Legacy Content
- Set up 301 redirects from the three original URLs to the new unified site.
- Archived outdated documents and provided clear links to historical data where relevant.
- Notified users and stakeholders of the change through email, social media, and press releases.

B. Ongoing Updates
- Established a workflow for City staff to update CSO event data, project documents, and public notifications in one place.
- Provided training and documentation for staff on maintaining the new site.
- Set up automated backups and monitoring to ensure site reliability and data integrity.

V. Challenges and Solutions
--------------------------
A. Data Consistency

VI. Conclusion
--------------
By merging the three Cambridge CSO websites into a single, well-organized platform, residents and stakeholders now have a one-stop resource for all CSO-related information, reporting, and engagement.
